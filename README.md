# TTK4145 Compendium
My personal compendium for the course TTK4145 Real-time Programming at NTNU based on my notes, some lecture material, the cirriculum
and the collection of notes from GitHub user mikkelti found [here](https://github.com/mikkelti/TTK4145-Notes). 

## Status
Currently in a very early phase, the readme will be updated when the personal compendium is done.
